### Introduction

The [LAMBDA](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12508718) function allows the user to construct [lambda terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Lambda_terms) and perform [Î²-reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#%CE%B2-reduction) on them. In practice, this means creating and applying custom functions.
